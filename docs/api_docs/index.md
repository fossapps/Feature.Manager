# Consuming Service
You can use REST api to consume data from any service you'd like to create.

Please run the app and navigate to `swagger/index.html` to view swagger generated documentation.
You should be able to play around with API on this page.

If you want to generate client, please use `swagger/v1/swagger.json` as a spec to generate the client.
