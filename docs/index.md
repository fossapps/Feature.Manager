## Micro.Starter
A Starter Kit built with production in mind.
It contains things you're most likely to use in a project such as auth, monitoring, etc

## What will this contain?
As of now I see the following to be included on this kit:

- [x] docker support with docker-compose
- [x] background worker support
- [x] health check support
- [x] `ViewModel` to ensure communication is completely TypeSafe.
- [x] document controller response type for swagger
- [ ] Swagger Docs (`spec.json` endpoint and docs)
- [ ] Linting
- [ ] Docker image generation after doing CI testing
- [ ] Logging (probably with kibana, but maybe using interface instead)
- [x] Health Checks
- [ ] Caching
